# Algorithm Workbench 문제 풀이

## 문제 1  
**Q : Write a sequence of statements that use only PUSH and POP instructions to exchange the values in the EAX and EBX registers (or RAX and RBX in 64-bit mode). **  
**A :**  

---
## 문제 2
**Q : Suppose you wanted a subroutine to return to an address that was 3 bytes higher in memory than the return address currently on the stack. Write a sequence of instructions that would be inserted just before the subroutine’s RET instruction that accomplish this task.**  
**A :**  

---
## 문제 3
**Q : Functions in high-level languages often declare local variables just below the return address on the stack. Write an instruction that you could put at the beginning of an assembly language subroutine that would reserve space for two integer doubleword variables. Then, assign the values 1000h and 2000h to the two local variables.**  
**A :**

## 문제 4
**Q : Write a sequence of statements using indexed addressing that copies an element in a doubleword array to the previous position in the same array.**  
**A :**  

---
## 문제 5
**Q : Write a sequence of statements that display a subroutine’s return address. Be sure that whatever modifications you make to the stack do not prevent the subroutine from returning to its caller.**  
**A :**
